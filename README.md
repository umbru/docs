Based on the Bitcoin/Dash projects, Umbru aims to be the user friendly, private, decentralized and secure cryptocurrency of choice for old and new users alike. In the growing world of multiple cryptocurrencies arriving and departing almost daily, Umbru envisions slowly growing the ranks to become on par or surpass it's predecessors. Umbru currently operates a self-governing and self-funding model that enables the Dash network to pay individuals and businesses for work that adds value to the network.

If you are new to Umbru or cryptocurrencies in general we highly recommend reading through all documentations provided. Unlike fiat Umbru transactions cannot be reversed, transactions or actions are final with no governing body. For this reason the Umbru documentation has a high focus on safety and providing examples or 'step by step' guides where applicable to ensure your experience with Umbru is one of the best.
