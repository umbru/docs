# Governance

Umbru Governance is a voting and funding platform. This documentation introduces and details the theory and practice to use the system.

### The Process

#### Introduction

* Governance consists of three components: Proposals, Votes, and Budgets
* Anyone can submit a proposal for a small fee
* Each valid masternode can vote for, against or abstain on proposals
* Approved proposals become budgets
* Budgets are paid directly from the blockchain to the proposal owner

#### Proposals

* Proposals are a request to receive funds
* Proposals can be submitted by anyone for a fee of 5 UMBRU. The proposal fee is irreversibly destroyed on submission.
* Proposals cannot be altered once submitted

#### Votes

* Votes are cast using the registered voting address
* The voting address can be delegated to a third party
* Votes can be changed at any time
* Votes are counted every 21600 blocks \(approx. 30 days\)

#### Budgets

* Budgets are proposals which receive a net total of yes votes equal to or greater than 10% of the total possible votes \(for example over 448 out of 4480\)
* Budgets can be nullified at any time if vote totals \(cast or re-cast\) fall below the approval threshold
* Budgets are processed \(paid\) in order of yes minus no votes. More popular budgets get payment priority.

#### Persistence

* Proposals become active one day after submission
* Proposals will remain visible on the network until they are either disapproved or the proposalâ€™s last payment-cycle is reached
* Approval occurs when yes votes minus no votes equals 10% or more of the total available votes.
* Disapproval occurs when no votes minus yes votes equals 10% or more of the total available votes.
* The total available votes is the count of online and responding masternodes and can be seen by running the command `masternode count` in the Umbru Core wallet debug window. 

### Creating proposals

Once you have prepared your proposal and set up a website or post, it is time to submit your proposal to the blockchain for voting. While all tasks involved with creating a budget proposal can be executed from the Umbru Core wallet console, a tool providing a user interface have been developed to simplify this procedure.
