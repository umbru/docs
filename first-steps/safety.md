## Safety

If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to understand in comparison with the traditional banking system is that transactions occur **directly between two parties without any central authority** to facilitate the transaction. This also means that **you are responsible for your own security** - there is no bank or credit card company to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. If you forget or lose your wallet file, recovery phrase or PIN, you will permanently and irrevocably lose access to your funds.

Umbru is designed from the ground up to be fast, secure, fungible and private. In this sense, it is similar to cash or gold, but cryptocurrency can be spent locally and internationally with equal ease, if you are confident you are sending funds to the right destination. For these reasons, the Umbru documentation has a strong focus on safety and understanding the concepts and features that drive the Umbru ecosystem.

A few general safety guidelines:

* Do not trust any online service or person because they sound or look reputable. Always use an escrow service if you are buying peer-to- peer.
* Store your Umbru on a [hardware wallet](https://trezor.io) if possible. If not, then store your coins in the official [Umbru Core Wallet](https://umbru.io/wallets) or the official [Umbru Electrum Wallet](https://umbru.io/wallets).
* Do not use exchanges as wallets. Exchanges are for trading, not for savings.

## Impersonation

Scammers may attempt to impersonate well-known community members and manipulate you into granting them access to your system or wallets. This is usually done via private messages on the forum, Discord or email. The attacks are often targeted against masternode owners. If you require technical assistance, it is best to ask in a public channel on our [Discord](https://discord.umbru.io).

If you engage in personal chat with a well-known community member, verify their identity by their chat history or through their publicly available cryptographic keys. All community and core members will be able to verify their identity using signed PGP messages. 

Identities can also be verified on Keybase:

## Scams

There are many “fake” pages on the internet attempting to trick users into sending cryptocurrencies or “open a wallet”. Other scams include selling fake mining hardware, fake Bitcoin or altcoins with a similar name, and Ponzi schemes. Please be careful and do **NOT** trust any third parties listed here!
